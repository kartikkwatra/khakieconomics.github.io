I am an applied statistician, originally from Melbourne, Australia, but currently in NYC. I am head of
data science at frontier markets debt platform startup Lendable. 

Previously, I worked at 

- [The Data Science for Social Good fellowship](dssg.uchicago.edu) on uplift/attribution estimation for the Obamacare outreach effort in Illinois and across the US.
- [The Grattan Institute](grattan.edu.au), mostly on Superannuation policy, including fees, manager performance, mechanism design, and taxation. 
- [The Australian Treasury](treasury.gov.au) in the macroeconometrics modeling unit, and in the CGE modeling team on the (late) 2011 carbon tax. 

I did a masters in economics with an econometrics focus at the University of Melbourne, and 
a first-class honours degree in economics, focusing on exogenous growth and fiscal-monetary 
interactions, at La Trobe University.
